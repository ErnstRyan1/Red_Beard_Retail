Install:
* delete all of my scripts/cfgs/macros/etc from your Luxology/scripts and Luxology/configs folder. (or else the old versions will be run instead of these new ones)
* Take the senemodo folder from the zip and put it in the Luxology/scripts/ folder.
* Bind a key to this palette:
@window.pl 2 "Seneca Script and Gui Browser" form={senemodokit:sheet} 900 5 800 1530 1

Notes:
- A **HUGE** thanks goes out to Jeff Lane.  He's the one that set all of this up initially and it definitely wouldn't exist if it weren't for him.  :)
- Honestly, this gui isn't intended to be actually used.  It's just an organized library of my scripts so they're easily found and bound to hotkeys or new guis.
- All the scripts have tooltips describing what they do.
- if you ctrl-shift-click on a button, it will allow you to bind that button to a hotkey
- Some scripts require your mouse to be over a polygon (or just the 3d viewport, it depends on the case) in order for it work.  The script button name will have (MOS) in it and the tooltip will say "(mouseover script)" if that's the case.
- If you want to use the Super UV Tools, you have to set the proper game path and photoshop exe path in the sen_superUVsMini-->GlobalOptions form.
